To encourage a potential investor with $12–13 million to pursue something more specific, it's crucial to provide robust data and insights into the ROI of property investments, particularly around upgrades and sales after mortgage payments. Below are the steps for further investigation, along with online data sources that can provide relevant insights.

Further Investigations

1. Profit Expectations from Upgrades
  Types of Upgrades:
	Evaluate the ROI of individual upgrades, e.g., kitchen, bathroom, or structural enhancements.
	Research how specific amenities (e.g., pools, solar panels) impact home value in the target market.
  Key Questions:
	Which upgrades yield the highest ROI in different markets?
	What percentage of the property value should be allocated to upgrades for optimal ROI?
	How does market type (luxury vs. middle-income) impact upgrade priorities?

2. Sales After Mortgage Payments
  Mortgage Strategies:
	Examine how different down payment amounts affect cash flow for upgrades and sales.
	Compare ROI between outright purchases and leveraging mortgages for multiple properties.
  Market Timing:
	Analyze trends in how property values rise or fall post-upgrade and during resale.
	Explore the correlation between mortgage payments and the resale timeline.

3. Geographic Variance
	ROI data will vary significantly by region. Some upgrades (e.g., pools) are more desirable in warmer climates, while energy-efficient windows may be a priority in colder areas.

4. Buyer Preferences
	Investigate local market demands. For example, luxury buyers may prioritize home gyms and wine rooms, while middle-income buyers may look for updated kitchens and bathrooms.
	Examine what inspections and certifications (e.g., energy efficiency, safety) add the most resale value.
5. Investment Strategy
  Flipping vs. Holding:
	Compare short-term flips with long-term property holding strategies.
	Study ROI trends over time for different strategies.
  Bulk Properties:
	Investigate whether buying multiple properties and improving them simultaneously offers better returns than focusing on one high-value property.
