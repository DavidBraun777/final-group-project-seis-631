# Canvas Final Project

I am a real estate investor and would like to invest 12M dollars in the real estate market. I am particularly interested in single family homes or rental apartments unless you recommend other types of real estate which may return maximum profits. My interest is to buy properties, do the upgrades and then rent the properties, however I am also interested in blooming markets where if needed, I can sell the properties quickly. What part of the country should I invest in to receive maximum gains.

Questions (listed below)

I like visuals thus show me many plots, charts, and graphs. (Bonus points) 20 Points

Video presentation (Everyone must participate in the video and identify what part they worked on including the coding) 20 Points
